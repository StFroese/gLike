INSTALLATION:

Linux & MAC OS:
Go to your main gLike directory and type 'make'.


RUNNING gLike:
An example to load the gLike environment is shown in the rootlogon.C file under ./scripts. Then you can execute a script such as 'jointLklDM.C' that will read a config file from ./rcfiles such as 'JointLklDM.rc'.


CAUTION:
On MAC OS, one might have to add the path to the gLike library (/path/to/gLike/lib) to 'DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' to succesfully run scripts using gLike.


DOCUMENTATION:
Go to your main gLike directory and type 'make doc'. The documentation will be generated under ./htmldoc. You can navigate in it openning the file './htmldoc/index.html'.
